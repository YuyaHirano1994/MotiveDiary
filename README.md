## About

## What's this

Motive Diary is a diary application that will help you meet your challenges.  
Set goals and record your daily progress.  
You can easily review your progress.  
And cheer on your fellow people as they take on their own challenges.

### Why did I create this

I would keep track of my studies, often using the #100daysofcode hashtag on Twitter to record them.  
However, when I wanted to review at my records, I could not easily do so.  
So I created an app that allows you to easily review your daily records and your own records.

### Challenge

Created CRUD web application using React and Supabase.  
Material UI was used for the appearance to create a unified look and feel.  
I also used Recoil for state management and touched on the latest skills.
